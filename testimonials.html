                <blockquote class="">Brian Pete provided our district with engaging, thought-provoking and timely professional development during the 16-17 school year. Teachers
                    left meetings with multiple strategies and the modeling practice to implement those strategies the next day with students. Brian's
                    enthusiasm for learning and sense of humor kept the discussions lively while teachers developed integrated practices to raise student
                    levels of critical thinking and the abilities to express those thoughts. Our feedback from staff was very positive and evidenced through
                    observations of classroom practices

            <blockquote class="">Just wanted to share two things with you from today. My first class went fine, but afterward I realized that I'd unwittingly left out many
                of the engagement and skill-building strategies that we've been discussing. I defaulted to something less engaging because I was trying
                to figure out how to best manage all of the beginning-of-year elements that need to be covered in four half-hour classes this week.
                I turned to my notes from Brian Pete's session, and I was able to tweak what I had planned for my next class to include more activities
                designed with student engagement and building 21st century skills in mind. I'll keep putting them into play for the rest of the week

    <p>
        <blockquote class="">I’ve been looking forward to teaching Sunday School since last Wednesday when we hosted Brian Pete as a trainer. So many tips, tricks and
            tactics! So many strategies! Today I was subbing and had a very full SS class; nine “lively” 9th graders. We read through a story from
            the lesson (Legion, the multiple personality fellow) with each student reading one verse aloud, and me clarifying terms and keeping
            the pro-nouns in order. And then it got fun: “Everyone stand up,” I said, “move around and find a partner from the other end of the
            table” “Tell your partner they are the best looking person in the room” “With your partner identify the three key events in the story”
            etc, etc. Well, you get the idea. They were moving, talking, identifying, listing, voting, writing, switching partners a couple of
            times, etc. It was FUN! I don’t even wonder if they had fun, I KNOW they did. They learned, and they will remember, because THEY said
            it, they talked it through, they sifted out the info, and they identified the HEALING aspects of the story! Maybe the best part though
            is that they will look back at that class as fun and productive with lots of energy. Thank you, thank you, thank you, for bringing
            Brian to campus. What a great use of time and treasure! Top notch instruction with REAL, useable results. Awesome.
            <p>
                <br />Thanks, Jon.

    <h3>You transformed my classroom! Brian!
    </h3>
    <p>
        <blockquote class="">Many thanks to you and your partners for a wonderful perception shift I had after attending your seminar. I had the pleasure of seeing
            both of your presentations in Lake Placid. I have been teaching for 15 years and thought I was doing a great job. I went back and made
            a few changes and I am blown away by the results. I have been underestimating my students and buying into the mindset that they can't
            achieve higher level thinking because they are learning disabled/ speech language impaired. Shame on me. Thank you. You have made a
            profound difference in my teaching style and the education of my students. Your wife may be the world's best teacher now but my goal
            is to take the title away from her by the time I retire.

            were fabulous! I can’t wait to find time to read the book! (and thanks for the book…) The many ideas that I will be able to use in
            my classroom/workshops The presentation by Robin and Brian: So much excitement and ideas All of the terrific ides that I can take back
            and use with my workshops/trainings Were the variety of transfer processing strategies that were modeled. I have a ton of new ideas
            to process an reformulate Robin and Brian! Practical, integrated, results oriented and enjoyable. Added value to staff development
            Too much to list – Graphic org. foldables, Visual dialog, Passing the buck Professional Development Standards, dissecting presentations
            to show how they meet the standards and good practices It was all our pleasure to host you! I would love for this to be a continuous

    <h3>Dear Robin and Brian, I am so sorry that I have taken so long to write this...</h3>
    <p> Dear Robin and Brian,
        <br /> I am so sorry that I have taken so long to write this thank you note. Over 300 of the 500 people took the Wildly Exciting Education conference
        for either credit or CEUs, and I just finished reading and scoring all of them. Whew - finally back in touch with the world!!
        <br /> Thank you so much for making our conference a huge success! The conference participants appreciated your presentation so much. Here are
        just a few of the comments I found when reading the papers (all of the papers were so positive about your presentation):
        <br /> “This presentation was worth its weight in gold. The presenters were both engaging and knowledgeable on the subject matter. I felt that
        they both did a wonderful job of presenting in a fashion that could be replicated in classroom setting. They were both very good at bring
        attention to the task at hand which started the presentation extremely well.” (District Administrator)
        <br /> “Today’s conference was just outstanding! I loved listening to Robin and Brian talk about Informative Assessments. The humor, interactions,
        and learning games kept us engaged the entire day. Time just flew by today!!” (HS teacher)
        <br /> “Oh my goodness! I haven’t laughed that hard or that much during a presentation ever! What a wildly entertaining day it was, not to mention
        a hugely resourceful day as well. I don’t even know where to begin, but I guess I’ll go from the start. Brian and Robin kept me one-hundred
        percent engaged.” (Elementary teacher)
        <br /> “The magic of Robin and Brian was terrific! They work so well together and their presentation was enthusiastic and engaging! One of my
        favorite things that Brian talked about was the “assessment OF learning” being analogous to the television show “CSI” or an autopsy. I
        think he was right. If we aren’t going to assess and monitor and use the results for some positive action, then it’s like working on a
        dead; “…it’s over…there’s nothing left to do.” What’s the point if there isn’t anything we can do to fix it? In “assessment OF learning”,
        it’s a done deal, whereas, in the “assessment FOR learning,” it’s more like the television show “House.” They do many diagnostic tests
        to figure out what’s wrong with the patient and try to make a difference. That is a more appropriate model for teaching, if we keep in
        mind that we want to have successful learners leave our classrooms. The idea of “just because I taught it, doesn’t mean they caught it”
        really makes sense! Robin and Brian did a superb job of giving ideas for strategies to use in the classroom to help kids “catch it,” all
        of which were put together in our foldable books.” (Middle Level teacher)
        <br /> “This was probably my favorite presentation of the week. Not only were Brian and Robin very dynamic speakers, I liked their format, how
        they had us practice almost all of the strategies they were suggesting. They made a great point when they said teachers are more likely
        to use a strategy in their classroom if they are comfortable with it. By having us use the strategies we became more comfortable with them
        than if they had just explained them alone. I feel like since taking the EDG 637 class on assessments, I have been making a real effort
        to use more formative assessments. However, after this presentation, I realized that I am mainly using the rigorous type of formative assessments
        – having students practice test-like questions and then analyzing their answers to look for misconceptions and skills that need re-teaching.
        I am very excited to have a list of routine and reflective activities to add to my arsenal. I will use many of the activities and ideas
        they suggested next year in my classroom.” (Special Education teacher)
        <br /> “First and foremost I have to say, I can’t wait to share each and every strategy I experienced during this presentation with the teachers
        I work with. The day literally flew building a case for a high energy organized pace that allows students to collaborate in a safe risk
        free environment where standards for achievement and accountability are clearly stated. The strategies proved over and over again that
        you can actually “teach less and learn more”. It also became apparent to me that these approaches to informational assessment contribute
        to a building a strong community of learners who are reflective while “thinking about thinking” (metacognition). On many occasions I found
        that just when I thought the experience would be “over” another layer was added thus scaffolding skills. I overheard a colleague say, “When
        you think you are done with student’s thinking, go one step further”.
        <br /> The planning required to assess in this manner is certainly imperative. I will set aside PLC sessions to discuss and further examine through
        active practice these strategies. I will also design opportunities for teachers to converse about student work/products together for the
        purpose of designing instructional next-step lessons, re-teaching, needed interventions and or accelerated lessons.” (Building Principal)
        I hope you have a wonderful school year as you provide additional profession development experiences to help more teachers and administrators
        improve teaching and learning. Thank you SO MUCH!!

            development sessions we've ever had. There were some experienced teachers at that table who have gone through a lot of PD in their
            days. I wanted to write this message to let you know how much I appreciate your hard work, and your innovative and entertaining methods
            of relating information. Thank you for the refreshing way you relate to teachers. You two actually "get it". Teachers desire great
            ideas that work--show us how to do it and we'll do it. Inspired by your talk, on which I took copious notes, I have started a blog
            called Intergrade: Instant Teaching Ideas. Your ideas and activities are serving as the first series of blog posts because they are
            quickly and easily woven into the classroom. Brilliantly done! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Warmest regards and best wishes for
            your future presentations,

            analogy was probably the best I’ve heard to differentiate between standards, curriculum and instruction. I will be able to refer back
            to these analogies as I prepare something for my students to “eat”.I was completely engaged and never bored. Thank you, thank you,
            thank you. Thanks for coaching us through the acitivites.
            <br />Brian Keep doing what you do! Never Have I had a presenter commend public school educators and show data that supports such commendations
            in such a genuine way. You are made for this! Your work is spreading like wild fire in our school. Projects are starting, learning
            strategies are being used and strategies are being shared. I'm doing a major PD and all those that attended Brian's workshop are sharing
            out. I have never seen anything overtake our school and spread quite like this. Its the most positive thing I've seen here in a long

    <h3>•Brian Pete has been a very dynamic PBL presenter for Metuchen School District the last two summers.</h3>
    <p>
        <blockquote class=""> He has engaged and inspired my staff in ways that very few other presenters have been able to. Brian first facilitated a group of 16 teacher
            leaders in a PBL in a Nutshell workshop in 2015. The teachers involved all developed and implemented a PBL Unit with great success
            as a result of his training. Based upon my staff's enthusiastic response to Brian's workshop, we invited him back the next summer for
            a two day workshop on Everyday PBL and the number of teacher participants doubled. I believe the increase in participants and the high
            number of returning staff members gives evidence that his workshop was very well received and appreciated and that the first cohort
            spoke very highly of him to his peers. At the end of his last workshop this summer, staff told me they really enjoyed how practical
            his Everyday PBL strategies were, how engaging and funny he was and how excited they were to translate his teachings into high quality
            PBL lessons for their students. I would describe him as an effective communicator of best practices in PBL and a highly engaging presenter
            who leaves his participants with a great deal of enthusiasm to implement their learning. We all look forward to his presentations immensely
            and take a great deal away from every session with him.

            and went back and reworked their presentations for today. They used the elevator speech, Serve and Volley, Quotes, Gather, Process,
            Apply, Three Musketeers, ABC Graffiti, lots of Turn and Talk, movement, Strategy vs Activity, etc.
            <br /> •Talk about "use the next day strategies!" Saw it in action for myself today! To our local experts, Y'ALL, DID THAT on today! An awesome

            job. Anyway, this new job is to be a Literacy Coach for Special Ed. and General Ed. teachers. I had to do a 10-minute lesson. So, I
            whipped out your book, From Staff Room to Classroom II and went to the section on teaching PLC's. I've attached what I presented as
            I am very proud of it and I wanted to show you that I took your taco metaphor and "made it my own" to have it also apply to special
            ed. students. Combined with my wealth of experience, this certainly got me the job and I thank you. I just want you to know that, if
            nothing else, you have made a HUGE difference with me and I will be frequently using your activities in the very near future.

    <h3>Some principals even invited Robin and Brian to do additional work with teachers at their schools </h3>
    <p>
        <blockquote class="">Robin Fogarty & Brian Pete worked with the Office of Principal Preparation and Development to design four days of high interest / high
            energy professional development for principals. The workshop series was a great success primarily because Robin and Brian modeled best
            practices throughout the presentation of their material. The principals loved the opportunity to be actively engaged with content and
            quickly recognized strategies that they could easily transfer into their work with teachers at their school sites. Some principals
            even invited Robin and Brian to do additional work with teachers at their schools following our introductory training. They have made
            famous "the tiny transfer book" and other clever strategies. Robin and Brian are in high demand to present at national conferences
            and are frequent travelers to exotic world-wide destinations, but their home office is in Chicago and they are very much committed
            to serving a local Chicago audience.

    <p>
        <blockquote class="">The magic of Robin and Brian was terrific! They work so well together and their presentation was enthusiastic and engaging! The idea of
            “just because I taught it, doesn’t mean they caught it” really makes sense! Robin and Brian did a superb job of giving ideas for strategies
            to use in the classroom to help kids “catch it,” all of which were put together in our foldable books. (Middle Level Teacher, Grand
            Rapids, MI) This was probably my favorite presentation of the week. Not only were Brian and Robin very dynamic speakers, I liked their
            format, how they had us practice almost all of the strategies they were suggesting. I will use many of the activities and ideas they
            suggested next year in my classroom.

    <h3>I can’t wait to share each and every strategy...</h3>
    <p>
        <blockquote class="">First and foremost I have to say, I can’t wait to share each and every strategy I experienced during this presentation with the teachers
            I work with. The day literally flew building a case for a high energy organized pace that allows students to collaborate in a safe
            risk free environment where standards for achievement and accountability are clearly stated. The strategies proved over and over again
            that you can actually “teach less and learn more”. It also became apparent to me that these approaches to informational assessment
            contribute to a building a strong community of learners who are reflective while “thinking about thinking” (metacognition). On many
            occasions I found that just when I thought the experience would be “over” another layer was added thus scaffolding skills. I overheard
            a colleague say, “When you think you are done with student’s thinking, go one step further”. The planning required to assess in this
            manner is certainly imperative. I will set aside PLC sessions to discuss and further examine through active practice these strategies.
            I will also design opportunities for teachers to converse about student work/products together for the purpose of designing instructional
            next-step lessons, re-teaching, needed interventions and or accelerated lessons.” (Building Principal) I hope you have a wonderful
            school year as you provide additional profession development experiences to help more teachers and administrators improve teaching
            and learning. Thank you SO MUCH!!

    <h3> I’m excited about starting another workshop tonight and seeing what develops with this group of teachers.</h3>
    <p>
        <blockquote class="">Thanks for a wonderful workshop in Philadelphia at NSDC and a copy of The Adult Learner. I am learning to use its contents as I continue
            with my current workshops and plan for the future. I implemented the Take-Away Window for the teaching/strategies modeled during a
            6-hour workshop in December. This turned out to be an eye-opener for the teachers and myself. One of the first activities was for teachers
            and their partners to review lessons that they would be teaching to their students. Then, the teachers shared the strategies that they
            would use to teach the lessons. I was surprised that 100% of the teachers described a whole-group, teacher directed activity. By the
            end of the workshop, after I had modeled several other strategies and noted them on the Take-Away Window, all but one of the teachers
            shared a lesson that was more respectful of students’ different abilities and learning styles. I’m excited about starting another workshop
            tonight and seeing what develops with this group of teachers.

            in hopes of learning several strategies to improve their presentation skills. Instead, we discovered so much more! We walked away with
            a structure and tools for effective planning of staff development; we now talk a common language about the adult learner and how teachers
            can transfer workshop training into the classroom; and we polished our presentations skills so we have adults in our workshops "doing
            most of the talking and learning". “Good program. Met my expectations.” “It was great! It helped with how to narrow down information
            into an activity (you are/you will). Good start on rubrics.” “The Cooperative Learning course made this real for me for the first time.”

        <blockquote class="">Robin and Brian’s workshop re-inspired, validated, and re-directed our existing professional development team of mentor teachers to focus
            more clearly on designing professional development opportunities that foster immediate transfer for participants. Robin and Brian clarified

            research-based strategies we can use on-site with our teachers to improve instruction and impact student achievement in our district.
            Our four-day workshop “From Staff Room to Classroom: The Adult Learner and Change Theory” was fast-paced, completely interactive, challenging,
            and fun for our whole team – from assistant superintendent to brand new campus mentor teacher. Both Robin and Brian are masterful presenters

            and insure our own “immediate transfer” of learning to these roles.
            <br />Fabulous learning experience for all!
