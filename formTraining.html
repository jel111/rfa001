                <blockquote class="">Brian Pete provided our district with engaging, thought-provoking and timely professional development during
                    the 16-17 school year. Teachers left meetings with multiple strategies and the modeling practice to implement
                    those strategies the next day with students. Brian's enthusiasm for learning and sense of humor kept
                    the discussions lively while teachers developed integrated practices to raise student levels of critical
                    thinking and the abilities to express those thoughts. Our feedback from staff was very positive and evidenced
                    through observations of classroom practices </p>

                <blockquote class="">Just wanted to share two things with you from today. My first class went fine, but afterward I realized that
                    I'd unwittingly left out many of the engagement and skill-building strategies that we've been discussing.
                    I defaulted to something less engaging because I was trying to figure out how to best manage all of the
                    beginning-of-year elements that need to be covered in four half-hour classes this week. I turned to my
                    notes from Brian Pete's session, and I was able to tweak what I had planned for my next class to include
                    more activities designed with student engagement and building 21st century skills in mind. I'll keep
                    putting them into play for the rest of the week

            <p>
                <blockquote class="">I’ve been looking forward to teaching Sunday School since last Wednesday when we hosted Brian Pete as a trainer.
                    So many tips, tricks and tactics! So many strategies! Today I was subbing and had a very full SS class;
                    nine “lively” 9th graders. We read through a story from the lesson (Legion, the multiple personality
                    fellow) with each student reading one verse aloud, and me clarifying terms and keeping the pro-nouns
                    in order. And then it got fun: “Everyone stand up,” I said, “move around and find a partner from the
                    other end of the table” “Tell your partner they are the best looking person in the room” “With your partner
                    identify the three key events in the story” etc, etc. Well, you get the idea. They were moving, talking,
                    identifying, listing, voting, writing, switching partners a couple of times, etc. It was FUN! I don’t
                    even wonder if they had fun, I KNOW they did. They learned, and they will remember, because THEY said
                    it, they talked it through, they sifted out the info, and they identified the HEALING aspects of the
                    story! Maybe the best part though is that they will look back at that class as fun and productive with
                    lots of energy. Thank you, thank you, thank you, for bringing Brian to campus. What a great use of time
                    and treasure! Top notch instruction with REAL, useable results. Awesome.
                    <p>
                        <br />Thanks, Jon.

            <p>
                <blockquote class="">Many thanks to you and your partners for a wonderful perception shift I had after attending your seminar.
                    I had the pleasure of seeing both of your presentations in Lake Placid. I have been teaching for 15 years
                    and thought I was doing a great job. I went back and made a few changes and I am blown away by the results.
                    I have been underestimating my students and buying into the mindset that they can't achieve higher level
                    thinking because they are learning disabled/ speech language impaired. Shame on me. Thank you. You have
                    made a profound difference in my teaching style and the education of my students. Your wife may be the
                    world's best teacher now but my goal is to take the title away from her by the time I retire.

                    <p>

                <blockquote class=""> Robin Fogarty and Brian Pete were incredible! The many ideas that I can use in my presentations Everything
                    from Robin and Brian – They were fabulous! I can’t wait to find time to read the book! (and thanks for
                    the book…) The many ideas that I will be able to use in my classroom/workshops The presentation by Robin
                    and Brian: So much excitement and ideas All of the terrific ides that I can take back and use with my
                    workshops/trainings Were the variety of transfer processing strategies that were modeled. I have a ton
                    of new ideas to process an reformulate Robin and Brian! Practical, integrated, results oriented and enjoyable.
                    Added value to staff development Too much to list – Graphic org. foldables, Visual dialog, Passing the
                    buck Professional Development Standards, dissecting presentations to show how they meet the standards
                    and good practices It was all our pleasure to host you! I would love for this to be a continuous relationship
                    so we can cycle through all the great workshops you present. You are certainly a treasure and I will
                    be in touch!
