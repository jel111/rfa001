                        <p>Unlocking student talent is an approach to personalizing learning? In brief, it’s about putting kids first by giving them “voice
                            and choice” in their own learning. Integrated into the 21st Century classrooms of differentiated learning that vary the “pace
                            and face” of instruction to target the individualized differences. These purposefully-designed student-centered classrooms,
                            encapsulate the accepted concept of personalizing learning. It is when these three components intersect, differentiation, individualization
                            and student-centeredness.This is the next generation of the differentiated classroom and the added refinements are clearly
                            outlined: Personalized learning adapts a metacognitive approach that fosters self-direction, self- monitoring and self-evaluation.
                            In essence, personalized learning is student ownership. However, this new model is guided by motivating factors that ignite,
                            invigorate and instill the learning, as well as fostering, metacognitive, reflective, coaching and feedback. Personalized learning
                            means greater student achievement through self-determined change (interests), challenge (goals) and choice (methods). In short,
                            the thrust is to engage students in ways that they become the “stewards of their own learning”.</p>

                        <p>How do we prepare our students for the test of life? We teach them how to learn when they are not being taught! In other words,
                            we give them the gift of self-reflection, self-awareness, self-initiative, self-direction, self-assessment and self-regulation
                            – the gift of knowing when they know, and when they don’t know. Metacognition: The Neglected Skill Set for Empowering Students,
                            is written with the teacher in mind. It is more practical than theoretical, but most definitely grounded in research findings
                            and connected to emergent data. With the 30 ready-to-use metacognitive strategies in this book, teachers will deepen learning
                            for their students through explicit reflections on planning, monitoring and evaluating their own work. As students learn how
                            to “think about their own thinking”, they become more aware and, thus, better able to make adjustments on their own work. They
                            gain a sense of ownership, and teachers get results they can count on through students empowerment. Metacognition is like magic
                            for 21st century classrooms – it changes student behaviors before your eyes.</p>

                        <p>The quintessential question, “How do we know what we know?” seems to drive the quest for high performing learners to learn more,
                            dig deeper, explore, investigate and in the end, be able to validate and justify. With rigorous principles paralleling the
                            International Baccalaureate curriculum framework, (as well as other recognized curriculum frameworks) drive that inquiry. While
                            “knowledge comes on the coattails of thinking, the Theory of Knowledge approach extends this, as students dig into the evidence-based
                            scenarios about, ”How we know what we know”. This professional learning enhances the work of students with the depth and breath
                            of mega-thinkers. It supports the remarkable curriculum work, with complementary discussions and exercises that provide that
                            added, oomph! Grounded in principles of curiosity, confidence, connectedness, reasoning, communication, reflection and open-mindedness,
                            practical threads of thinking, practicing and performing are ever-present. Empower students with lifelong skills that will
                            impact every sector of their lives.</p>

                        <p>Real world application drives 21st Century, academic learning. In this generation, students don’t learn to do they do to learn.
                            They live in a fast-paced society and are impatient with the slow and steady rhythm of the traditional classroom. How do significant
                            curriculum shifts toward a more relevant, rigorous, inquiry-oriented approach occur within this assessment-driven culture?
                            How do teachers guide kids to dig into authentic problems? How do they support “high-tech” applications in a digital-rich classroom?
                            How do they foster collegial, “high-touch” teamwork on projects and papers? How do they challenge students with rigor in “high-thought”
                            explorations, investigations, and experimentations? “The times, they are a changing”, and they are changing at breakneck speed.
                            How do we, as leaders, retool schools to meet the challenges in relevant ways?</p>

                            not that complicated! Moving toward relevance in the curriculum that uses 21st Century, real-world applications, student inquiry
                            models are front and center-problem-based, project, and service learning experiences are among the most frequently cited. It’s
                            efffective to get started with tools already familiar to teachers today: graphic organizers, essential questions, rich and
                            relevant content, rigorous thinking skills, digital-rich tools for searching and researching, collaborative team work and presentation
                            skills. Simply put: PBL is like DIY (Do It Yourself) projects- Do It-to-Learn-It, 21st Century methodology, rather, than Learn
                            It-to-Do-It, 20th Century traditions.</p>

                        <p>Using the Three Story Intellect to assure teachers that students are moving through the three levels of thinking-gathering, processing
                            and applying, students learn to think more deeply. As they become more aware of their thinking, confidence increases dramatically,
                            and the shift from the teacher-directed classroom environment to a student-centered culture of respect, responsibility and
                            reliability is the ultimate goal. Learn how to teach kids to think, critically and creatively. Help students begin earlier,
                            rather than later, to adapt self-dispositions of mindfulness that prepare them for test of life. Grounded in 21st Century thinking
                            processes: productive problem solving, mindful decision-making and creative innovation, students develop awareness and control
                            of their own actions, words and deeds. (Can substitute DOK’s or Bloom’s Taxonomy to align to district). </p>
