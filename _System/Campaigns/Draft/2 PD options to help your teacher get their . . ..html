    <br />PD Title:
    <br /><span><strong>Preparing for the Test of Life, Not Just for the Test</strong><br />We believe that to make a difference in students’ lives, beyond the test, we must focus on the skills that they will need today, tomorrow and forever. It is imperative that we are teaching students explicitly how to think - to analyze critically, to hypothesize with confidence, to clarify with purpose, to make inferences that matter if they are truly college and career ready. <br /><br />This is an intensive, collaborative, job-embedded data-driven classroom focused professional development session designed to integrate thinking skills into instruction to raise the rigor of classroom thinking and discourse and get every student engaged for deeper learning. <br /><br /><b><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Deeper learning consists of </span>
    <em style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">“the delivery of challenging academic standards to students in innovative ways that allow them to learn, and then apply what they have learned.”</em>

        <br />PD Title:
        <br /><strong>Student Engagement through Student Ownership</strong>
        <br />Personalized Learning is about putting students first. When students are authentically engaged with content that has depth and complexity and when
        they have a sense of ownership of the learning decisions, they have a true emotional attachment to their own achievement. It does NOT mean all
        students working at their own level on a specific computer-based software program.
        <br />
        <br />Personalized learning which “emphasizes (1) developing trusted and caring relationships between teachers and students; (2) connecting learning
        to the real world; (3) linking curriculum to students’ interests, strengths, and aspirations; (4) providing students individually targeted instruction,
        practice, and support where they are struggling; and (5) creating more flexible learning environments.” Also, "helping students receive personalized
        learning services advancing their coursework through a variety of means to prepare them to be college and career ready."
