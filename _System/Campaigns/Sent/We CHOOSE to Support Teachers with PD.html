    <br /> <strong>Differentiated Instruction Cluster<br /><br /></strong>
    <br /> <strong>A. From Theory to Practice: <em>From “From Aboutitis to Actionitis”(</em>Perkins)<br /></strong>
    <br /> Differentiation is research-based, yet practical ideas put that theory into practice. That means <em>change </em>with multimodal instruction to engage
    every student with<em> challenge</em> and <em>choice</em>. Differentiation isn’t every student doing a different lesson. It’s every student is doing
    the same lesson, <em>differently,</em> based on readiness levels, learning profiles and interests. Change the content! Change the process! Change the
    product! Change kids’ learning.
    <br />
    <br /> <strong>B. Diverse Learners: <em>Different Strokes for Different Folks</em><br /></strong>
    <br /> What is it we want kids to know? How do we know if they know it? What do we do when they don't...or do (DuFour)? When we know our learners well, their
    readiness to learn, their strengths and weaknesses and their personal interests and motivations, we can change, modify and accommodate the learning.
    Tomlinson’s mantra: “Know your kids. The more you know, the more you can differentiate.”
    <br />
    <br /> <strong>C. Three-Tier Lessons: <em>Doing, Viewing, Construing Meaning<br /></em></strong>
    <br /> Learn to build a Three-Tiered Lesson (concrete, representational, abstract) for the multimodal differentiated classroom: Do, View, Construe Meaning.
    Practice developing a <em>concrete</em>, hands-on lesson where students <em>do </em>something. Add a representational element to <em>view</em> their
    ideas. Finally, incorporate the<em> abstract</em> element of language skills for students as <em>construe</em> <em>meaning </em>with a deeper understanding
    of the text.
    <br />
    <br /> <strong>  Critical Thinking Cluster<br /></strong>
    <br /> <strong>E. Preparing for the Test of Life: <em>Not Just for the Test!</em><br /></strong>
    <br /> Prepare youngsters for the <em>test of life</em>, not just for <em>the test</em>. Their scores will soar because they will know how to think well,
    address challenges pragmatically, and persevere to the end. Discover new
    <br />
    <br /> And, uncover old strategies used before. Learn to raise the rigor and engage students in compelling situations. Draw them into the learning, engage
    them mindfully and foster transfer and application across disciplines.
    <br />
    <br /> <strong>F. Questions: Are We Causing Kids to Think?<br /></strong>
    <br /> The level of questioning determines the level of thinking. Higher order, open-ended, divergent questions have no answer. Well, at least not one single
    answer. And that is distressful to students because they want the <em>right</em> answer, not the ambiguity of many possible responses. Learn to infuse
    ambiguous, intriguing questions into your academic discussions. Cause kids to think more deeply with essential questions and watch those dendrites
    grow
    <br />
    <br /> <strong>  Literacy and Learning </strong><strong>Cluster</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
    <br /> <strong> G. Close, Critical Reading: <em>Designed for Science and Social Studies</em><br /></strong>
    <br /> “What are you going to learn when you go school?” “I’m going to learn how to read.” That is the standard image of the educated person. Of course,
    learning to read is a complex task that requires decoding intricate, symbolic data into spoken and written language. Humans are hard-wired for speaking
    and listening, but not the complex acts of deciphering the printed page. Teach RSVP-E for close reading success for all-both “early readers” and “second
    chance” learners.
    <br />
    <br /> <strong>H. Write Every Day, Every Way:</strong> <strong><em>1-Minute Write to 1000 Word Essay!</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em>
    <br /> Using the rich and relevant content knowledge across the disciplines, seven explicit writing strategies are shared to support and strengthen traditional
    subject matter content in class assignments and assessments. Composition moves from scaffolded models to quick writes, to structured essays and “wee
    wikis”. In addition, several editing strategies demonstrate rigor with self-assessing and peer-assessment tools.
    <br />
    <br /> <strong>  For</strong><strong>mative Assessments </strong><strong>Cluster</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
    <br /> <strong>I. Formative Assessments as Feedback<em>:</em></strong><em> <strong>Knowing What Students Know! </strong></em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
    <br /> <em>Routine</em>-<em>Everyday</em> assessments of thinking begin with classroom interactions that give students multiple opportunities to authentically
    demonstrate their thinking. <em>Reflective</em>-<em>Metacognitive </em>assessment strategies empower students to know and improve their thinking. R<em>igorous Assessments</em>    go deeper and inform current and future instructional practices in the classroom.
    <br />
    <br /> <strong>J. Differentiating Assessments: <em>How Do We Know What They Know?</em><br /></strong>
    <br /> Differentiated assessment models are comprised of three powerful sets of tools that provide a spectrum of information on student learning: traditional
    assessments (tests, quizzes, works samples), student learning portfolios (writing folders, learning preferences, and biography of a work) and performance
    assessments (projects, presentations, actual performances. Use all means of feedback from students.
    <br />
    <br /> <strong> Inquiry Learning-PBL </strong><strong>Cluster</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
    <br /> <strong>K.  PBL In-A-Nutshell:</strong> <strong>Problems to Solve vs. Answers to Remember!</strong><em>&nbsp;</em>
    <br /> Lectures, rhetoric and one-way broadcasts still reign supreme in today’s classrooms, because they are efficient, the pacing is controlled and the
    curriculum is covered. Inquiry learning like PBL just takes too much time! No, it doesn’t. Not when you teach with a model that values repeated, rehearsed
    and repetitive trials with the inquiry process. Learn the secrets of PBL in A Nutshell to share with students.
    <br />
    <br /> <strong>L.  High Tech! High Touch! High Thought!  Retooling Schooling<br /></strong>
    <br /> Our generational geniuses don’t, <em>learn by doing, </em>they <em>do to learn.</em> They live in a fast-paced society and are impatient with the
    slow and steady rhythm of the traditional classroom. How do teachers integrate “high-tech” applications; foster collegial, “high-touch” teamwork on
    projects and papers; challenge students with rigor in “high-thought” explorations? “<em>The times, they are a changing</em>”, and they are changing
    at breakneck speed. How do we retool schools to meet the remarkable challenges of this amazing 21<sup>st</sup> Century?
