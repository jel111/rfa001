    <br /> <em>“Everywhere I go I see way too much scaffolded and prompted teaching – through twelfth grade</em>...
    <br />
    <br /> <em>Transfer means, you have to be able, on your own, to size up when to use what you previously learned,</em>
    <br />
    <br /> <em>i.e. analyze the challenge, and judge what to do, mindful of a repertoire of prior learnings; </em>
    <br />
    <br /> <em>then, implement a purposeful move, and assess its effect.</em>” Grant Wiggins

    <br /> <strong>Readiness for Real World Challenges!</strong>
    <br />
    <br /><strong style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">If Not Us, Who?</strong>
    <br /> To say the words, “Our goal is College and Career Readiness” is not enough.
    <br /> It is not just something we talk about and test about and fret about. <strong>It’s our challenge!</strong>
    <br />
    <br /><strong style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">If Not Us, Who?</strong>
    <br /> School leaders must create a sense of urgency, not for higher test scores, but for
    <br /> <strong>students equipped with the wherewith all to succeed</strong> against all adversities; to win.
    <br />
    <br /><strong style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">If Not Us, Who?</strong>
    <br /> School is the last stop before the Independent years set in. It’s up to us to develop
    <br /> academic proficiencies, as well as <strong>student confidence, independence, student agency.</strong>
    <br />
    <br /><strong style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">If Not Us, Who?</strong>
    <br /> Leadership teams learn how to support teachers in their important work at this annual,
    <br /> conference, teaching teachers how to<strong> prepare our kids for the test of life</strong>, Not just for the test.
    <br />
    <br /><strong style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">If Not Us, Who?</strong>
    <br /> If you believe the words,<strong><em> If not us, who?</em></strong> you know the journey ahead is paramount for success.
    <br /> It’s time to rally the forces that make things happen in your school to network within this Think Tank .

    <br /> <strong>Subject: Wow and Wow again...</strong>
    <br /> First and foremost, Robin and Brian, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! You really provided a new set of eyes for our Instructional Leaders on yesterday.
    Your professional learning engagement is literally the TALK OF THE TOWN TODAY! Folks have actually thanked me for PD, which in my world, does not happen
    all that often!!! Even have Administrators asking for professional books/resources for their toolboxes!!!
    <br /> Here is how you know that you hit a home run...we held a mini-conference today and the presenters left your session on yesterday and went back and
    reworked their presentations for today. They used the elevator speech, Serve and Volley, Quotes, Gather, Process, Apply, Three Musketeers, ABC Graffiti,
    lots of Turn and Talk, movement, Strategy vs Activity, etc.
    <br /> Talk about "use the next day strategies!" Saw it in action for myself today!
    <br /> To our local experts, Y'ALL, DID THAT on today! An awesome two days of professional learning on behalf of the students we serve! Much-obliged to each
    and every one of you!
