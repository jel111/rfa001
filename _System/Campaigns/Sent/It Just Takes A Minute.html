<p style="margin-left: 20px;">&hellip;to read about a game-changing “best practice" that literally reconstitutes our old &amp; worn, skill and drill practice routines. Anders Ericsson,
    is the man. An amazing psychologist, he was the first to consolidate findings about the role of how a certain kind of practice, sometimes called the
    "10,000 Hours Rule”, is attributed to how one becomes an expert in any field. His story is compelling and the implications for practice as part of
    learning are basically turned upside down &nbsp; &nbsp;
    <br />
    <br /><strong><em>Developing expertise is not about long, tedious practice session, but rather, astonishing results </em></strong>
    <br /><strong><em>are produced with brief, practice sessions, multiple, "reach and repeat”  iterations, driven by self-motivated</em></strong>
    <br /><strong><em>learners, constant goal setting and expert coaching and fee</em></strong><strong>dback.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>

    <br /><em>Brian Pete from Robin Fogarty &amp; Associates provided our district with engaging, thought-provoking and timely professional development during the 2017 school year. Teachers left meetings with multiple strategies and the modeling practices to implement those strategies the next day with students. Brian's enthusiasm for learning and sense of humor kept the discussions lively while teachers developed integrated practices to raise student levels of critical thinking and the abilities to express those thoughts. Our feedback from staff was very positive and evidenced through observations of classroom practices.</em>
