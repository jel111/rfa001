    <br /> Metacognition is a Blue Ribbon Strategy for increasing student learning. In fact, Hattie, rates metacognitive strategies among the top five learning
    interventions. While teachers may have heard the word, metacognition, in their Education 101 classes, beyond that, it is seldom labeled or modeled
    as a viable and vital instructional strategy.
    <br />
    <br /> Yet, teaching students about reflective thinking and metacognition (thinking about thinking) increases student learning; it also, increases your achievement
    numbers and reflects the results of a blue ribbon school.

    <br /> Robin Fogarty has designed an on-site professional development session that is an engaging, interactive and practical presentation, with metacognitive
    strategies modeled across grade levels and disciplines.

    <br /> Teachers will leave with the skills, and the confidence to take their students into the deep end of the pool, understanding the powerful impact that
    occurs when students know how to think about their own thinking and learning. <a href="https://robinfogartydotcom.wordpress.com/2017/12/13/thinking-about-your-own-thinking/"> Thinking about Your Own Thinking</a>

    <br /> How do we prepare youngsters for the test of life? We teach them how to learn when they are not being taught. In other words, we give them the gift
    of self-reflection, self-awareness, self-initiative, self-direction, self-assessment and self-regulation . . . and the gift of knowing when they know
    and when they donâ€™t know.
