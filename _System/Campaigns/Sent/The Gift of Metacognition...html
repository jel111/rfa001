    <br />Dear COLLEAGUES,
    <br />We have a gift for your teachers that has value
    <br />far beyond the session with us. It is the gift that
    <br />keeps on giving; that prepares students for the test of life.

    <br />There is no gift as precious as the gift of metacognition.
    <br />Teaching kids...to think about their thinking, to learn about
    <br />their learning, and learn how to understand how they
    <br /> can solve their own problems.
    <br />
    <br />In short, give students the greatest gift of all;
    <br /> the gift of knowing what to do, when they don’t know what to do.
    <br /> At RFA<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">teach</span>PD, we are experts on the thinking-side of schooling,
    <br />not so much on the right answer-side of getting by.
    <br />
    <br />Invite us to spend professional learning time with your teachers, and
    <br />the tone, tenor and temperament of classroom instruction will take
    <br />a turn. Students become engaged and empowered about their own learning,
    <br />through the reflective thinking.
    <br />
    <br />Metacognition is beyond the cognitive. It allows students to step back
    <br />and think about where they are going, how it’s going and what to do next.
    <br />Yes, this day of classroom reflections with your teachers&hellip;taps into
    <br />the neglected skill of reflective mindfulness for student success.

    <br />
    <br />Thinking about thinking is the magic of the message we share,
    <br />along with the strategies that ring true as students develop a sense of
    <br />self agency&hellip;as they learn how to manage their learning and start using the
    <br />quick-win strategies to rigorously think through their own challenges.
