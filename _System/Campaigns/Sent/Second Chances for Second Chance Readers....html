<p><span>Yes, they need “a second chance” to master the fundamentals of reading, of course, but more importantly they need to discover the fun of finding things out through their reading.<br /><br />  Yet, not the BEST, but the ONLY way to get good at reading is to read. But what do we do with the kids who can’t read, don’t read, or just, won’t read because they’re NOT GOOD READERS, YET!  WE DON”T LET THEM GIVE UP! (They may be middle level and high school students and this could be their last chance to learn how to read well).<br /><br />  Danielle Martin-March 8, 2018 ( Excerpts)<br /><br />  OPINION: READING ALOUD TO STUDENTS<br /><br />  “One strong solution is to have teachers read aloud to their classes, then move into leading inquiry-based discussions about texts. In this shared-experience vision of reading aloud, students are following along, taking notes with old-school technology: a pencil.”<br /><br />  “A talented, expressive teacher can bring a poem, story or other written work to life and allow listeners to experience things they may not have noticed had they simply read the piece to themselves”.<br /><br />  “Becoming a Nation of Readers” identified listening as “the single most important activity for building the knowledge required for eventual success in reading.”<br /><br />  HIGH SCHOOL READ ALOUDS- Daniel Martin<br /><br />  Five reasons why this classroom practice works:<br /><br />  1) Even if a text is above a student’s reading level, that doesn’t mean it’s above their comprehension level.<br /><br />  2) Teachers can access a wide range of reading levels within one classroom.<br /><br />  3) Reading aloud is an effective option for “popcorn” &amp; “round-robin” reading.<br /><br />  4) Hearing a text read aloud also supports students’ ability to remember key information.<br /><br />  5) Listening to a story can be more relaxing for busy high school students, and can lead to a lifelong appreciation for storytelling and literature.<br /><br />  GETTING SECOND CHANCE READERS TO READ IS POSSIBLE!<br /><br />  Teachers have the knowledge, the knowhow and the wherewithal to...<br /><br />  INVITE SECOND CHANCE READERS TO EXPERIENCE SUCCESS!<br /><br />  TAKE THE RISK.
