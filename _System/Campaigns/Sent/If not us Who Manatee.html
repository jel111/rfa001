    <br /> <em>“Everywhere I go I see way too much scaffolded and prompted teaching – through twelfth grade</em>...
    <br /> <em>Transfer means, you have to be able, on your own, to size up when to use what you previously learned,</em>
    <br />
    <br /> <em>i.e. analyze the challenge, and judge what to do, mindful of a repertoire of prior learnings; </em>
    <br /> <em>then, implement a purposeful move, and assess its effect.</em>” Grant Wiggins

    <br />To say the words, “Our goal is College and Career Readiness” is not enough.
    <br /><span>It is not just something we talk about and test about and fret about. <strong>It’s our challenge!</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span>If Not Us, Who?</span>    </strong>
    <br />School leaders must create a sense of urgency, not for higher test scores, but for
    <br /> <strong>students equipped with the wherewithal to succeed</strong> against all adversities; to win.

    <br /> <strong><em>The hallmark of RFA is active, engaged professional learning that results in immediate transfer from the staff room to classroom the very next day. Robin, the teachers’ teacher wrote the book on transfer.

You really provided a new set of eyes for our Instructional Leaders on yesterday. Your professional learning engagement is literally the TALK OF THE TOWN TODAY! Folks have actually thanked me for PD, which in my world, does not happen all that often!!! Even have Administrators asking for professional books/resources for their toolboxes!!! <br /><span>Here is how you know that you hit a home run...we held a mini-conference today and the presenters left your session on yesterday and went back and reworked their presentations for today. They used the elevator speech, Serve and Volley, Quotes, Gather, Process, Apply, Three Musketeers, ABC Graffiti, lots of Turn and Talk, movement, Strategy vs Activity, etc. <br /><span>Talk about "use the next day strategies!" Saw it in action for myself today! <br /><span>To our local experts, Y'ALL, DID THAT on today! An awesome two days of professional learning on behalf of the students we serve! Much-obliged to each and every one of you! <br /> <strong><em>Marcella Heyward-Evans, Ed.D.</em>    </strong>
