<p><strong>Thinking about Thinking in IB Schools: How We Know What We Know by Robin Fogarty and Brian Pete</strong> is intended to complement and supplement
    the curriculum framework of international schools, particularly those that utilize the International Baccalaureate program. The driving questions that
    undergirds the book – “How do we know what we know?” – is the quintessential question that drives our quest to learn, explore, investigate and, in
    the end, validate and justify.

    <br />The discussions within this resource target the micro-skills of thinking, or the “think links” that act like connectors between subject matter and
    relevant processes across and within the learning areas. These target skills include analyzing, evaluating, comparing and contrasting, generalizing,
    making inferences, discerning cause and effect, imagining, visualizing and hypothesizing. Each chapter features instructional strategies to teach,
    practice and apply deeper thinking with the rich and rigorous content of the international curricula.
    <br />
    <br />Within Thinking about Thinking, seven thinking skill areas are delineated and each of the seven chapters features a lively discussion, explicit ways
    of thinking about particular ways of thinking and engaging strategies to involve students in the act of deep thinking about the required content. In
    addition, the chapters showcase compelling stories that serve to illustrate key points, and offer specific and explicit transfer strategies to illustrate
    how to foster immediate, authentic transfer and application to the F–12 classroom.

    <br />Knowledge comes on the coat tails of thinking (Perkins).We believe must practice the skills of higher order thinking to meet everyday challenges in
    their day.We also believe that as practices in reflective, metacognitive thinking develop students’ sense of agency, and control over their destinies
    with self-initiating, self-sustaining, and self-reflective behaviors become part and parcel of their habits of mind. Sprinkled with explicit thinking
    skills-visualizing, predicting, determining choice-coupled with reflection during the planning, monitoring and evaluating stages of projects and assignment.
    Infused with the rigorous principles paralleling the International Baccalaureate curriculum framework, and the richness and relevance of the concept
    that drives, the Theory of Knowledge approach to inquiry learning about how we know what we know, this session enhances the work of students with the
    depth and breath of mega-thinkers.
