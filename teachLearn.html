                            <p>It’s all done in your head. Math fact fluency means knowing the math facts, in addition, subtraction, multiplication and division,
                                mentally and with automaticity and accuracy in order to do math problems instantly. Did you know this simple skill of memorizing
                                math facts that can be accessed instantly and with cognitive automaticity, is a vital foundation for the study of the complex,
                                higher-level mathematics such  as algebra, geometry and calculus. The benefit can be striking. Students can free up their
                                working memory with fact fluency permitting time and attention for more difficult tasks of reasoning and problem solving.
                                Using a multi-sensory virtual model to impress learning on the brain from every direction, students follow a strategic
                                pathway to mastery: See it! Hear it! Say It! Type it! Solve it! BlueStreakmath is a Prek-8, standards-based content that
                                encompasses facts from 0-12. It is designed with specific content for Prek-3, early literacy students, as well as for regular
                                and second chance readers in grades 4-8. Students are on a one-to-one application working on their own, at their own pace,
                                with adaptive progressions to match and /or provide an adaptive challenge for their ability level.</p>

                        <p>Assessment and Instruction go hand in hand. In fact, assessments inform instruction with both formative and summative data.
                            The striking difference between assessment of instruction and assessment for instruction is found in the following two
                            questions. Assessment of instruction asks: How did I do? Assessment for instruction asks: How am I doing? Summative assessments
                            provide data for grades and rankings at the end point of the instruction. In this highly interactive session, participants
                            will learn about, teacher-tested, tried and true informative assessment tools that they can apply immediately in their
                            k12 classrooms. These tools and techniques are organized around three levels of implementation to use with ongoing, daily
                            assessments in the classroom. </p>

                    <p>Personalized Learning is about putting students first. When students are authentically engaged with content that has depth
                        and complexity and when they have a sense of ownership of the learning decisions, they have a true emotional attachment
                        to their own achievement. It does NOT mean all students working at their own level on a specific computer-based software
                        program. Personalized learning means greater student achievement through self-determined change (interests), challenge
                        (goals) and choice (methods). In short, the thrust of this professional learning is to learn more about how to foster student
                        engagement  as they become the “stewards of their own learning”.</p>

                    <p>And the beat goes on... The quest to address the talents and needs of each and every student in our classrooms is driven by
                        the very nature of the human brain. Every student sitting in that classroom has a uniquely different set of wiring. What
                        does that mean? It means if students learn differently, we must teach differently. RTI, differentiated instruction is the
                        melody of the diverse classroom of today-special education students, English learners, transient students, physically challenged
                        kids, including the high achievers and the gifted and talented. Using four different models -Change, Challenge, Choice,
                        Compatibility for differentiating lessons, the methods can be used alone or in concert with each other. </p>

                <p>The teaching/learning equation has two sides to the equation. One side focuses on the teacher and teaching. The other side
                    focuses on the learner and learning. For the teacher teaching, we have a burgeoning portfolio of "best practices" (Marzano
                    et al) that are research-based, teacher-tested, tried and true. There are the nine families of instructional strategies
                    that. For the learner learning, the research on the brain and learning is capsulated in these twelve principles distilled
                    from a meta-analysis of the literature by Renate and Geoffrey Caine. The twelve principles provide a rich philosophical
                    foundation for instructional decision-making. These comprise the basic, foundational equation, that guide the everyday
                    decisions teacher make about instructional input, student groupings, curricular designs and the range of assessments used
                    in classrooms today. If, in fact, these are proven practices of quality teaching and promising principles of quality learning,
                    then it is the equation we must master. It is the equation that explains how and why learning sticks, rather than disappearing
                    moments after it enters the brain/mind.</p>
